# Operations-2-integers
Program that performs operations on an integer (initial value 0). 
The program displays the value of the integer and then displays the following menu:(1.Add, 2.Division, 3.Subtraction, 4.Multiply, 5.Exit)
The program then asks the user to type an integer between 1 and 4. If the user types a value between 1 and 4, the operation is performed.
The new value of the integer is displayed and then the menu is displayed again and so on until you type 5.
When you type 5, the program ends.
Caution: You must use a function to define each operation. You must use a switch box. You must validate the user input,
in the event of an erroneous input, the application displays: enter an integer. And repeats the operation.
